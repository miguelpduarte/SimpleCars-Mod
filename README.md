# Simple Cars Mod

An attempt at a Minecraft Mod for Minecraft version 1.12.2.

The aim of this project is to understand development techniques used when developing on top of an existing project.

It should also help solidify Java knowledge and will probably be a fun endeavor :)

## Running

You can use the steps [here](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/) or simply open the build.gradle using IntelliJ (by importing existing project) and then run `gradlew genIntellijRuns` to generate the run configurations for IntelliJ IDEA.
